# Kristoshka - cooking calculator

This web app, made with React and Material UI, was requested by my girlfriend to help her with cooking. It is best to measure out ingredients in grams rather than volume measures like cups or teaspoons - volume measures are very unreliable, since you can get completely different amounts depending on how you scoop and pack the ingredient. A lot of recepies use cups, teaspoons, etc. unfortunately, so it's really useful to be able to quickly convert the amount to grams as you are cooking, without having to type a lot. Voice assistants like Siri often mess things up and, surprisingly, there doesn't seem to be a good easy-to-use calculator out there. Kristoshka to the rescue! It will quickly let you convert the most often used ingredients and will tell you the calorie info to boot.
